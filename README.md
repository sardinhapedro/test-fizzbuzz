Business Logic:
In the folder src/FizzBuzzChecker.js

I have the method with the console.log and 3 arrays for testing (2 of them are commented), you can make your own array, or just switch between arrays to test.



Tests:
Are made with Jasmine Framework, they are in the folder spec/FizzBuzzSpec.js

you can just run the SpecRunner.html that shows the tests running.
